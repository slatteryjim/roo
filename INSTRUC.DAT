  `%Welcome to the best Online Game available: R`9ealm `%o`9f `%O`9blivion`%!

`P  `$-`%Background`$-
        `7Many years ago, before your time, your peaceful village was
      `7ransacked and taken over by the power-seeking `%Rana`7 and his mutant
      `7slaves.  Together, they built an inpenentrable wall around the
      `7city with only one gate to the free world outside which was guarded
      `7by a huge giant named `%Mladimar`7.  Many warriors tried to kill `%Mladimar`7
      `7and died in the process.  So, in turn `%Murlim`7, the local sorceror,
      `7built an enchanted gate that only let the highest ranking warriors,
      `%Class Ten`7, pass through to attempt to best `%Mladimar`7.  There is
      `7a `%KEY`7 however, hidden somewhere in the city that will let
      `7those who are foolish enough to pass through the magical gate
      `7and attack `%Mladimar. (Seriously, I wouldn't try it!)
        
`P  `$-`%Your Quest!`$-   
        `$-`7To ultimately become a `%Class Ten`7 warrior and rid the village
         `%Mladimar.
        
`P  `$-`%Tips...`$-
        `$-`7Kill many forest-dwelling mutants and fellow warriors,
           `7until you have earned enough `%experience points`7 to take on
           `7your current level's `%Class Warrior`7.
        `$-`7Level up by defeating each level's `%Class Warrior`7.
        `$-`7Earn `%money`7 by finding it on the corpse of your kill.
           `7(YOU WILL DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY!)
        `$-`7Deposit money in the `%Bank`7 often so that if you get killed
           `7your foe will not get it.
        `$-`7You only have a set amount of `%Moves`7 per day.. You can
           `7increase these by buying an animal to ride on from the `%Stable
           `7and/or by buying better boots from the `%Shoe Cobbler`7.
        `$-`7Mutants are very good at hiding and the better fighters they
           `7are, the harder they are to find.  The higher level you reach,
           `7the better hunter you become, so you will always be fighting
           `7mutants that are about the same skill level as you.
`P        `$-`7When talking at the `%Bar`7, or writing mail or other various forms
           `7of scribing, you can write in `1C`2O`3L`4O`5R`6!  `7Just follow these rules when
           `7writing:
           `71=`1±  `72=`2±  `73=`3±  `74=`4±  `75=`5±  `76=`6±  `77=`7±  `78=`8±  `79=`7±  `70=`0±
           `7!=`!±  `7@=`@±  `7#=`#±  `7$=`$±  `7%=`%±
           `7REMEMBER:  `%```7 <-That character (not ') must ALWAYS preceed color codes!
           `7For example:
           `7 ``%Hello``$!!
           `7Would yeild: `%Hello`$!!
           `%Note: `7I made them the same as `2Legend of the Red Dragon's`7 color codes
                 `7so hopefully you will already be familiar with them.


`P`%                                Good Luck!!
